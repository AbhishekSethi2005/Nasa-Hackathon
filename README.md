# 🌍 Climate Change Story: Arctic Ocean 📖

Welcome to the **Climate Change Story** project! This website was built as part of the **2024 NASA Space Apps Challenge** 🌟. The goal is to use open-source data from the U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center to tell a compelling story about climate change, focusing on the **Arctic Ocean** and its challenges.

## 🌟 Project Overview

In this project, we aim to raise awareness about the ongoing changes in the Arctic Ocean due to climate change. The website provides detailed insights on rising temperatures, melting ice, and the impact of CO2 levels on the Arctic's fragile ecosystem.

### 🌊 Key Features

- 🧊 **Story of the Arctic Ocean**: Learn about the threats to one of the planet’s most fragile ecosystems.
- 📈 **Data Visualizations**: Utilize open-source data to showcase the effects of climate change.
- 🌐 **Interactive Design**: Explore various aspects of climate impact through an intuitive user interface.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/climate-change-story.git
2. Navigate into the project directory:
    ```
    cd climate-change-story
    ```
3. Open the index.html file in your browser to view the website.


## 📊 Data Sources

This project uses open-source data from the [U.S. Greenhouse Gas Center](https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions) and other scientific sources. The data highlights the following:

- 🌡️ **Temperature trends** in the Arctic region.
- ❄️ **Melting ice sheets** and the rate of ice loss over time.
- 🌍 **CO2 levels** and other greenhouse gas emissions.
- 🌬️ **Wind patterns** and ocean currents affected by climate change.

By using these datasets, we created visualizations and stories to showcase the **urgent need for climate action**.
